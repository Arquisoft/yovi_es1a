== Risks and Technical Debts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

| Risk | Description

| **Inexperience in Microservices Architectures**
| The team has limited experience in designing large-scale software architectures with multiple interconnected modules. This introduces the risk of defining incorrect boundaries between services or creating circular dependencies that complicate development.

| **Rust learning curve**
| Rust is a language we've never used before, so the learning curve is going to be very steep. There's a risk that implementing even simple features will take longer than expected due to the language's complexity and our inexperience.

| **Inexperience in using Docker**
| Setting up internal networks, volumes, and container communication (with Node.js and Rust) can create deployment and configuration problems that delay integration testing or implementation.

| **Data Consistency**
| When using a database without a rigid schema, there is a risk of data inconsistency if the model evolves and data migrations are not performed to update older documents.

| Technical debt | Description 

| **Non-persistent Game State**
| The current architecture manages active game sessions entirely in-memory within the Gamey Service. There is no real-time persistence layer for the game state (MongoDB is currently restricted to User management), meaning that any service restart or crash results in the immediate loss of all active matches.

| **Error Handling**
| Backend error handling is fundamental. The lack of a centralized logging and exception management strategy will hinder the diagnosis of problems in production.
