The game development company Micrati has decided to begin developing a web-based system where users can play different variations of Game Y, an existing strategic board game. The initial idea is to offer an entertaining and intuitive experience to users. It will also provide several different strategies with different difficulty levels to attract user interest.

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The main requirements of the system are:

- Provide a usable and functional version of the game with a variable board.

- Available on the web.

- Offer different strategies for playing the game with different difficulty levels selectable by the player.

- Allow users to register on the system.

- Allow users to view their game history (statistical data such as the number of games played, win/loss statistics, etc.).

- Offer the option to play against a computer or a bot with an API.

=== Quality Goals

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

|===
|Quality goal|Description
| **Usability**
| The system should be easy for users to use and learn how to use correctly. This will encourage them to use the application again and enjoy the experience.

| **Functionality**
| The system must consider and implement the requirements correctly, allowing users to play the game Y with different strategies, register in the application, consult their statistics...

| **Accessibility**
| The application must be available from the Web.

| **Performance**
| The app should respond to user requests within a reasonable timeframe. This prevents users from abandoning the app and ensures a positive experience that encourages them to return.

| **Maintainability**
| The system should be easy to maintain and extend. This is achieved by following good programming practices, maintaining excellent communication within the development team...

| **Security**
| The private data of registered users must be kept safe.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
