=== Whitebox Overall System (Level 1)

The following diagram shows the main interaction between the user and the system.

[plantuml, "level1_diagram", png]
----
@startuml
actor "User" as user
component "Yovi System" as yovi

user .right.> yovi : Uses
@enduml
----

Motivation::
Yovi (refering to our group game) is a web application that allows users to play the "Game of Y". The system acts as a single unit for the end user, providing registration, game logic, and history tracking.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| **User** | End-user interacting with the application via a web browser.
| **Yovi System** | The complete software solution handling the game logic and user data.
|===

=== Level 2

This level shows the decomposition of the system into the three main services defined in the project structure.

[plantuml, "level2_diagram", png]
----
@startuml
package "Frontend" {
    component "WebApp" as webapp
}

package "Backend Services" {
    component "Users Service" as users
    component "GameY Engine" as gamey
}

database "MongoDB" as db

webapp --> users : HTTP /createuser
webapp --> gamey : HTTP /game
users ..> db : Reads/Writes
@enduml
----

Motivation::
The system follows a modular architecture to separate the user interface from the logic services.
* **WebApp**: Handles UI and client-side logic.
* **Users Service**: Manages user registration and data.
* **GameY Engine**: Handles the specific rules and logic of the board game.

| **Building Block** | **Description**

| **WebApp**
| *Responsibility:* Provides the graphical interface for the user. It communicates with the backend services to perform actions. +
*Technology:* React, Vite, TypeScript. +
*Location:* `/webapp` directory.

| **Users Service**
| *Responsibility:* Manages user registration and stores user information. It exposes a REST API. +
*Technology:* Node.js, Express. +
*Location:* `/users` directory.

| **GameY Engine**
| *Responsibility:* Implements the core logic of the Game of Y, including move validation and bot strategies using Rust for performance. +
*Technology:* Rust. +
*Location:* `/gamey` directory.

| **MongoDB**
| *Responsibility:* Database used to persist user data and game history. +
*Technology:* MongoDB.
