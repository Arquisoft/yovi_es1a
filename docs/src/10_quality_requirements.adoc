== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

* Quality
** Modifiability (High)
*** Pluggable AI Strategies
*** Configurable Rules
** Interoperability (High)
*** Standardized YEN API
*** Language Independent
** Usability / DX (Medium)
*** Structured Error Messages
*** API Documentation
** Observability (Medium)
*** Contextual Logging
*** Crash Resilience
** Performance (Low)
*** State Reconstruction
*** Low Latency (< 200ms)

.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios
[options="header", cols="1,2,3,4"]
|===
|Priority (Imp, Diff) |Quality Attribute |Scenario |Expected Outcome

| **High, Low**
| **Modifiability**
| A developer wants to implement a new AI strategy **during the design phase** (Environment).
| The developer implements the YBot trait, requiring **no changes (0 lines)** in the core GameY logic (Measure).

| **High, Med**
| **Modifiability**
| The requirements change **during a maintenance cycle** (Environment) to include a new game variant.
| The system allows rule injection via configuration, ensuring **100% backward compatibility** with existing YEN save files (Measure).

| **High, Med**
| **Interoperability**
| An external bot (Source) sends a generic JSON move request **during runtime execution** (Environment).
| The system processes the YEN string directly **without requiring language-specific adapters** (Measure).

| **Med, Low**
| **Usability (DX)**
| A frontend developer (Source) sends invalid coordinates to the API **during integration testing** (Environment).
| The API returns a structured 400 error, allowing the developer to identify the bug source in **less than 1 minute** (Measure).

| **Med, Low**
| **Observability**
| A player or bot sends an illegal move (e.g., placing a piece on top of another) **during a live production game** (Environment).
| The system logs the specific **GameID and invalid YEN string** for debugging, returning a handled error **without crashing the session** (Measure).

| **Low, High**
| **Performance**
| A user refreshes the browser to resume a long match **during an active game session** (Environment).
| The system parses the YEN string and reconstructs the full board state in **less than 200ms** (Measure).

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
