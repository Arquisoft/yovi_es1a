== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

* Quality
** Interoperability (High)
*** Standardized YEN Format
*** No Data Adapters (Direct Mapping)
** Security (High)
*** Server Authority (Anti-Cheat)
*** Input Validation
** Modifiability (High)
*** Interface AI Strategies
*** Decoupled Game Engine
** Observability (Medium)
*** Contextual Logging (GameID)
*** Structured Error Responses
** Performance (Medium)
*** Fast State Reconstruction (<200ms)
*** Low Latency Parsing (<50ms)

.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header", cols="1,2,2,3,2,2,3,3,2"]
|===
|Ref |Attribute |Source |Stimulus |Artifact |Environment |Response |Measure |Priority (Imp, Diff)

| SC-01 | Interoperability | Backend | Sends a move request in YEN format | Rust game engine | Normal operation (runtime) | The engine processes the string directly without data mapping adapters | Processing time < 50 ms | High, Low

| SC-02 | Modifiability | Developer | Wants to add a new AI strategy | Rust source code (AI module) | Design/Maintenance time | The new strategy is added by implementing an existing interface | 0 lines of code modified in the main game engine | High, Medium

| SC-03 | Performance | User | Refreshes the webpage to resume a game | Complete System (Frontend + Backend + Rust) | Normal Operation | The system analyzes the YEN string and reconstructs the 3D board | Interaction Time < 200 ms | Medium, High

| SC-04 | Observability | Malicious User/Bot Error | Sends out-of-bounds coordinates (e.g., "Z: 99") | Server (Backend) | Normal Operation | The system logs the incident with context and returns a 400 error | The log includes GameID and the YEN string; Server uptime: 100% (no crashes) | Medium, Low

| SC-05 | Security | Cheater User | Sends a fake request claiming victory ("winner": true) without playing | Backend (Validation Logic) | Normal Operation | The server ignores the client data, checks the move history, and rejects the request | 0% of corrupted games in the database; Server authority is maintained | High, Medium

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
